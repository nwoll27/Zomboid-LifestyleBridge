A mod for Project Zomboid that attempts to make improvements to the Lifestyle: Hobbies mod created by Angry (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2997342681).

This mod depends on the Lifestyle: Hobbies mod to function.

Functionality to integrate the Lifestyle mod with the True Music mod will require both mods to be installed for this mod to work (this functionality will be optional and will be packaged in a separate sub-module).

Currently Supported: 
- Instruments can be played as a vehicle passenger.

In Progress:
- Survivors can dance to instruments.

Planned
- Survivors can dance to music generated by the True Music mod.
- Music generated by the True Music mod can apply mild positive music buffs.
- New "Music Instructor" starting profession.
- New "Dance Instructor" starting profession.
